This project includes the source code of the Web Developer Course taught by Colt in Udemy.
*URL of the Cloud9 repo : https://ide.c9.io/learnwithcolt/webdevbootcamp


There might be a few difference in the code, most notably my comments but the majority of the code should work just fine.

Steps to run the project :
    
    Clone the repository
    Use the command npm install
    Browse it through the localhost.
    .
    .
    .
    Profit (?)
    
*You need to have an instance of mongodb running as a service in your desktop.
